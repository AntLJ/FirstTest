# FirstTest
my first test of using

there are two projects here:
TestServer(TestServer.cpp + TestServer.vcxproj + pch.cpp + pch.h)and 
TestClient(TestClient.cpp + TestClient.vcxproj + pch.cpp + pch.h)

cause the two pch.cpp and two pch.h file have the same filename, and they have the same conntent,
so ignore it please.just download and copy them
